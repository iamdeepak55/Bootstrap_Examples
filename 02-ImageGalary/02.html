                <b>Introduction to Bootstrap: </b>
                Bootstrap is a free and open-source framework for creating websites and web applications. It's the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

                As the web evolves more and more toward responsive design, it can be a real challenge for web developers to keep up. Bootstrap can make things a whole lot easier. Bootstrap enables you to create responsive websites without you needing to do the "responsive" bit. Bootstrap takes care of that.


                <p><b>Advantages of Bootstrap</b><br>
                    One of the main benefits of development frameworks like Bootstrap is that they can help speed up development times, while maintaining quality and consistency across the site. You no longer need to re-design every element. And you don't need to spend hours trying to get everything looking and working right across browsers, platforms, and devices. By using Bootstrap, all (most) of the hard work is done for you.

                    Given Bootstrap is the most popular frontend development framework on the web, this skillset could be a useful one to learn. Adding Bootstrap to your bag of tricks could help you in many ways â€” from building websites faster, to landing your dream job.

                    Also, athough Bootstrap comes with its own set of styles, these are easy to override. You're not locked into the "Bootstrap design". You are free to use whichever Bootstrap components you choose, while adding your own on top. There are thousands of websites out there that are built on Bootstrap, but with their own design.</p>
